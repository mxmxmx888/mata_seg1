              Recipes are stored with consistent fields (ingredients, method,
              time, difficulty), but presented in natural language so they are
              readable for real cooks, not just the database.

            <p class="small text-muted mb-0">
              Simple keyword and ingredient search lets users find something to
              cook based on what they already have in the kitchen.

              The system is designed from the start to support favourites,
              comments and sharing, even if those features are added as later
              iterations.
